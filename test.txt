MVVM Violations Found:
1. DumpsPage.xaml.cs
Issue: Direct service instantiation in constructor
Should move: Service instantiation should be handled through dependency injection
2. ServicesPage.xaml.cs - Major violations
Issues:
Direct service instantiation (_servicesReader, _installationService)
Business logic for loading and displaying services
Data manipulation (LoadInstalledServices, LoadAvailableServices)
UI creation logic (CreateServiceCard, LoadServicesUI)
Event handling with business logic (InstallButton_Click)
Error handling mixed with UI updates
Should move: All service operations, data binding, commands, and properties to ViewModel
3. SettingsPage.xaml.cs - Major violations
Issues:
Direct service instantiation
Implements INotifyPropertyChanged (should be in ViewModel)
Business logic for loading/saving settings
Data manipulation (PopulateAvailableVersions)
File picking logic
Should move: All data operations, property change notification, and commands to ViewModel
4. SitesPage.xaml.cs - Major violations
Issues:
Direct service instantiation
Business logic for loading sites and site types
UI creation logic (CreateSiteCard, LoadSitesUI)
Complex event handling with business operations
Multiple async operations in code-behind
Should move: All service operations, data binding, commands to ViewModel
5. DashboardPage.xaml.cs
Status: âœ… Good - Only contains initialization code

Move to ViewModels:

All service instantiation (use dependency injection)
Business logic and data operations
Observable collections and properties
Command implementations
Error handling logic
Keep in Views:

Only UI-specific event handlers
Navigation logic
UI state that doesn't affect business logic
Use Data Binding:

Replace direct UI manipulation with data binding
Use Commands instead of event handlers where possible
Implement proper ObservableCollections for lists
